This is an almost feature complete alpha of Test::Builder1.5
(Test::Builder with Test::Builder2's internals).  It is all but
feature complete and passes nearly all tests.

If you find any bugs or incompatibilities, please report them at
https://github.com/schwern/test-more/issues


WHAT TEST::BUILDER2 IS

It is a rewrite of the skeleton that holds together all the popular
Test:: libraries.  Its aim is to increase flexibility and allow Perl
authors to do pretty much whatever they please while still not having
to worry about the minutiae of test formats or coordinating with other
test libraries.


WHAT TEST::BUILDER2 IS NOT

It is not a rewrite of Test::More.  Maybe later we can do Test::More2.

It doesn't directly effect how people write tests, but how people
write test libraries (which people then use to write tests).  Many
things that were previously impossible are now possible.


COMPATIBILITY

Test::Builder, Test::More and Test::Simple will continue to work as
before.

Test::Builder2 is not directly compatible with Test::Builder, thus the
new namespace.

Test modules built with Test::Builder will work together with those
built with Test::Builder2.


WHAT WORKS

All the existing Test::Builder and Test::More features
Test event hooks
Multiple formatters (ie. you can output something other than TAP)
Test::Builder using Test::Builder2
Event Handlers (ie. things like Test::NoWarnings)


WHAT DOESN'T WORK

Assert stacks (ie. no more $Test::Builder::Level)
Structured diagnostics
Threads
Test::Aggregate
Test::Group
Test::SharedFork


WHERE TO LOOK

An outline of the redesign is in TB2::Design.
