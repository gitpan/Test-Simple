Write _print_comment() utility routine to make sure comments come out
right, newlines handled, etc...

Test use_ok() with imports better.

Rejigger the internals to be an OO singleton.

Make Test::Simple and Test::More less incestuous.

Add BAIL_OUT()

Crack plan() out into it's own routine so things like selectively
determining if you should skip the whole test is easier.  Right now you
have to do:

    BEGIN {
        if( $some_condition ) {
            eval q{use Test::More skip_all => $why};
        }
    }

Make a way to control exported functions

Make a way to ask "Are we passing so far?"
