    Test use_ok() with imports better.

    Add BAIL_OUT() (little known Test::Harness feature that basically
    declares that the universe has turned out all wrong and the test
    will now stop what it's doing and just go back to bed.)

    Add a way to ask "Are we passing so far?".  Probably a
    Test::Builder method.

    eval_ok().  A replacement for this sort of thing.  My main concern
    is that it not screw up caller().

        my $result = eval { some_stuff };
        is($@, '',                  'didn't explode');
        is($result, 'something',    'and it ran');

    Expose Test::Builder->diag in Test::More.

    Decide if the exit code behavior on failure is a useful default
    case.
